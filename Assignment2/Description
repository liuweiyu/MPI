1.MatrixMlpOneStep
This code is single-pass algorithm for matrix multiplication. It takes five arguments, which are first matrix's column number, first matrix's row number,
second matrix's row number, input file's path, output file's path.

Input file's each line is in the following format:
matrix's identity(M or N), row index, column index, entry

And each line of the output file's format is:
row index, column index, entry

2.MatrixMultiplicationTwoStep
This folder contains the code for two-pass matrix multipliation algorithm. It takes two arguments: input file's path, output file's path.
The formats of input file and outpufile are the same as those in single-pass algorithm code.

3.GenerateRandomMatrix
This one is to generate random matrix. It takes row number and column number of the matrix as arguments and write matrix into a file in the following format:

num_rows num_cols
binary dump of matrix entries in double precision

4.ReadMatrix
The code in this directory is to read two matrices, which will be multiplied, from their related random matrix files into a single file with internal format of code 1 and 2.

5.WriteMatrix
This one has the opposite function as code 4. It is used to translate the result file in code 1 and 2's internal format into the binary format.

6.TestResult
This folder contains all test related files, including binary matrix files, text matrix files, result matrix in text format and result matrix in binary format.
